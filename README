# Rorschach Inblot Test
The Rorschach test is a psychological test in which subjects' perceptions of inkblots are recorded and then analyzed using psychological interpretation, complex algorithms, or both. Some psychologists use this test to examine a person's personality characteristics and emotional functioning.

This is a simple project to allow someone to create a procedurally generated Rorschach inkblot using JavaScript on a browser that supports HTML5 and more specifically, the canvas tag.

Included are two files:
  * rorschach.js
  * rorschach.html
  
The rorschach.html file will allow you to quickly generate a Rorschach inkblot in your browser (tested with Google Chrome). This rorschach.html file references the rorschach.js file that contains the guts of the inkblot painting.
